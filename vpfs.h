/*
  vpfs is a READ-ONLY file system aimed at accessing packages (mostly Sony PKGs
  but can be extended to .zip or .tar archives) as if they had been fully
  extracted/decrypted on the storage media.

  This is accomplished by overriding the sceIo#### calls to transparently
  access the package data as needed.

  Note that, because the file system is read-only, creating files or directories
  or renaming stuff will always return an error.
  It is however possible to mark an entry (dir, file) as deleted.

/*
  VPFS structure:
    vpfs_header_t;
    vdfs_pkg[nb_pkgs];
    uint32_t sha[nb_items]; // first 32-bits of the SHA-1 for the path (the remainder of the SHA-1
    vpfs_item_t[nb_items];  // is in the xsha[] array from the relevant vpfs_item_t)
    char dir_list[];        // concatenation of NUL terminated UTF-8 strings, grouped by directory
    uint8_t additional_local_data[] (work.bin, modded files, etc)

  pkg_table_offset = sizeof(vpfs_header_t);
  sha_table_offset = pkg_table_offset + nb_pkgs * sizeof(vpfs_pkg_t);
  item_table_offset = sha_table_offset + nb_items * sizeof(uint32_t);
  dir_list_offset = item_table_offset + nb_items * sizeof(vpfs_item_t);

  Lookups:
  - root path ("ux0:app/TITLE_ID/") must match the vpfs path ("ux0:app/TITLE_ID.vpfs")
    => split on slashes and see if we have a .vpfs for that. Could even have a whole
       "ux0:/app.vpfs"...
  - (short) path -> SHA-1 (short means "ux0:app/TITLE_ID/" is removed)
  - SHA-1 index = pkg_item index
  Ultimately, we'll want to sort the SHA-1 and do a *PROPER* lookup, by starting at the most
  appropriate position in our table and dichotomizing the shit out of our search. Probably also
  want to speed things up through using uint64_t for lookup (though memcmp is probably
  optimised enough). If SHA-1 not found in our tables, hand over to the original call.

  For dir entries:
  - Add trailing '/' to path if missing
  - SHA-1 of directory path -> pkg_entry (should also have type dir)
  - offset = start of directory entries in names table (concatenation of NUL terminated strings)
  - offset + size = end of directory entries in path tables
  - to find out if entry is file or dir check for terminating /

  TODO!!!: We're screwed if we try to mix real content with our content when listing dir entries...
           Or, are we? Can still try to call org call after we're done, which should list both our
           stuff and real-one. WILL NEED TO TEST THIS WITH work.bin or mod data. Or we can add
           placeholder for work.bin and fill it with data at the end of vpfs record

  TODO: Calls MUST be reentrant as we may have multiple threads accessing the same app (and
        potentially the same item!) => anything we'd like static must go into the private fd data.

  For stat:
  - All items always have the same date as the PKG
